Diploma Project: Designed and 3d modeled in Fusion 360 a cartesian 3dPrinter and used the 3d model to manufacture the printer using a CNC milling machine. The main body is made out of wood boards, which have been cut to shape using the GCode path generation function from Fusion 360 to drive a CNC milling machine. The Printer uses an ATmega2560 microcontroller  to control the three stepper motors for the XYZ axes and one stepper motor for the nozzle using a set of stepper drivers
